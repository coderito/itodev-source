# 🇨🇱 Juan Gerardo Eulufi Salazar


**`Digital Craftsman (FullStack-Developer)`**

I'm an indie front-end developer creator building my version of the digital world one step at a time. All coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing all the way to solving real-life problems with code.I am full of attitude to be able to work as a team and to be able to share my knowledge in each project, challenging obstacles, solving problems and learning from each new experience.
